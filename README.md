## Description

The Applied Data Science program at Syracuse Universityâ€™s School of Information Studies prepares students for a career in data science by teaching them how to analyze and operationalize all sizes of data sets, understand information science and management principles and applying data science to enterprise operations and processes. In courses such as Database Administration, Applied Data Science, Big Data Analytics and Information Visualization, final projects, homework assignments and lab reports were developed to produce insights using Microsoft Access, SQL Server Management Studio, R, R-Studio, Python, Tensorflow, Apache Spark, Adobe illustrator and Excel. These insights that come out of the hard work of School of Information Studies students provide invaluable knowledge that they can bring to the data analytics field immediately upon graduation.
